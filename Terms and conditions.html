    <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
    <p>
        FIRST, AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“Terms”, “Terms of Use”, or “Agreement”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS ONLINE OR MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT SERVICE, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WAIVERS OF RIGHTS, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, AND YOUR INDEMNITY TO US. THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN COURTS, JURY TRIALS, OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE..
    </p>

Welcome and thank you for using a service provided by Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliates (“Warner,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Use are a legally binding agreement between you and Warner and govern your use of our online, digital, or mobile services, including our websites, software, applications, games, and any of our other products and services in connection with which these Terms of Use are posted or from which they are linked (collectively, the “Service”).

Certain aspects of the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which may include, among other things, particularized age requirements, codes of conduct, sweepstakes and contest rules, and payment or subscription terms (collectively, “Additional Terms”). When Additional Terms are made available in connection with any aspect of the Service, those Additional Terms also apply to your use of that aspect of the Service and control in the event of a conflict with these Terms.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms (which are incorporated herein by reference) and acknowledge our collection and use of your information as described in the Privacy Policy(ies) applicable to the Service (“Privacy Policy”). If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms or Additional Terms, do not access or use the Service.

<h4>Changes to these Terms</h4>
<p>
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify these Terms (including applicable Additional Terms) from time to time. You agree that we may notify you of modified terms or policies by posting them on the Service, and agree that your continued use of the Service after such notice constitutes your agreement to the modified terms, which will govern your ongoing use of the Service. Thus, you should review the posted Terms of Use and applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service. Any modifications to
 these Terms will supersede the prior version for all activity occurring after the revised version has been made available.
</p>

<h4>Your Representations</h4>
<p>
By accessing, previewing, or otherwise using the Service in any manner, you represent and warrant that you have sufficient legal capacity to enter into this Agreement or, if you lack such capacity (for instance, if you are a minor), that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to do so. You represent and warrant that you have read, understand, and agree to abide by these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, and that you have read and understand the data collection and use practices set forth in the Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h4>The Warner Service</h4>
<p>
Warner grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and fully revocable license to access, view, and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use solely as provided by these Terms and as expressly permitted by the features and functionality of the Service, subject to your complete compliance with these Terms of Use and all applicable Additional Terms. The Service may allow you to view, preview, select, stream, and access certain content, including video, audio, graphics, photos, and text
 (collectively, “Content”). Such use may be limited (for example, to supported devices or by number of simultaneous streams per account; by geographic region; by time window; by subscription level; or otherwise, and access will require your use of an approved device with sufficient connectivity).

The Service and Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, or other intellectual property rights that are owned by Warner or its licensors. Warner respects the intellectual property rights of others and asks that you do the same. Any unauthorized use of Content or any other aspect of the Service, or any portion thereof, will constitute a violation of copyright or other intellectual property rights, and Warner reserves the right to fully prosecute such violations and enforce its rights to the fullest extent
 of the law, including seeking both civil and criminal penalties. Violation of this Agreement in any manner automatically terminates the license granted to you herein and obligates you to cease all use of the Service and Content. Any authorization to copy material granted by Warner in any part of the Service for any reason is restricted to viewing a single copy for non-commercial, personal, entertainment use only, unless otherwise specified, and is subject to your keeping intact all copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices.

Except as expressly provided herein, Warner does not grant you any other express or implied right or license in or to the Service or Content and all right, title, and interest that Warner has in the Service and Content are retained by Warner, including the right to modify, discontinue, or temporarily suspend any or all of the Service at any time, with or without notice.

No aspect of the Service constitutes legal, financial, medical, or other category of professional advice.
