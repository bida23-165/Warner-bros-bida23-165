Warner Bros. began when the brothers Warner (Albert, Sam, Harry and Jack L.) incorporated their fledgling movie company on April 4, 1923. In 1927, the release of the world’s first “talkie,” (synchronized-sound feature film), “The Jazz Singer,” set a character and tone of creativity, courage, innovation and influence that would become synonymous with the name Warner Bros.
 And--as Al Jolson foretold in this milestone movie--“you ain’t heard nothin’ yet!”
    </p>
    <p>
Since those early days, Warner Bros. Studios has amassed an impressive legacy based on world-class quality entertainment and technological foresight and created a diversified entertainment company with an unparalleled depth and breadth. Its century of continued success has been built on a foundation of long-term creative relationships with many of the world’s leading talent, 
and an unwavering dedication to excellence.
